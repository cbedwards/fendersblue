yearly-summary.csv - Similar to sitely-summary.csv, but one row per year per site.This may be more useful for making more detailed plots, including yearly gaussian curves. Because we have individual fitted curves for each of the years, we have included the coefficients of the fitted gaussians as b0, b1, and b2 (unscaling has already been taking care of). Here we have the phenological metrics for each site-year rather than their means or slopes across years. We also include two other metrics, because why not. Tenperc is the day of the 10% quantile, somewhat analogous to the day of first activity. h is the peak activity, which is sometimes used in other papers. The badfit column will be FALSE *unless* the best-fitting values are biologically implausible (which should never happen, as we should have removed those years from our analyses). badboot shows the fraction of initial bootstrapped values that are biologically implausible for that site-year. bootnum shows the number of parametric bootstrapped simulations that were actually used after rejecting biologically implausible ones (this should always be the same number, as we generate extras in case we must reject some).

sitely-summary-full.csv - as sitely-summary.csv, but fit using a single model across all sites. main results of our baseline analysis, and likely to be the basis of most figures. Each row represents a single site. The first set of columns represent either the averages ("vals.*") across years or slopes ("slopes.*") through years of key phenological metrics (mu = day of peak abundance; fp = days from 0.1 to 0.9 quantiles of gaus furve; N = abundance index) along with 95% CI as measured by 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of parametric bootstrapping. The final two columns show the fraction of bootstrapped values that were biologically implausible (these were removed before metrics were calculated) across all years and the highest such fraction among the years. Note the new inclusion of the Observable Flight Seasion, denoted ofs.
